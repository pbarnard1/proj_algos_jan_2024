## Outline:
- Binary search trees:
    - Searching for a value in a tree to see if it can be found
    - Getting the height (depth) of the tree
    - Getting the size (number of nodes) in the tree
    - Traversing the tree three different ways (if there's time):
        - In-order traversal
        - Pre-order traversal
        - Post-order traversal
